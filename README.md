## Git from RStudio

From within RStudio, we can perform the same versioning actions that we can
in GitHub, and much more.  Plus, we have the natural advantages of the 
programming IDE with code completion and other features to make our work
easier.

- Add files to version control
- Commit changes
- Push commits to GitHub
